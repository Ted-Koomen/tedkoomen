This is my personal website / portfolio. This is currently under construction. This app will be built with full MERN stack, along with hosting on AWS within a Docker container. 

Some interesting modules used in this app are `emotion-js`, and `styled-system` which are both libraries for styled components. I chose to use emotion for performance reasons. It has been shown to render 25x faster than other styled component libraries and SCSS / CSS. Styled-system is a great add on for CSS in JSS (or JSS) which allows props to be passed into your styled component.
